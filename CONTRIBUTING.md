# General

I am always open to improvements and suggestions.
Use [issues](https://github.com/Tux/CSV/issues)

# Style

I will never accept pull request that do not strictly conform to my
style, however you might hate it. You can read the reasoning behind
my [preferences](http://tux.nl/style.html).

If some co-maint accepts and pulls a pull-request, I will correct wrong
indentation and spacing.

I really do not care about mixed spaces and tabs in (leading) whitespace

In perl5 code, Perl::Tidy will help getting the code in shape, but as all
software, it is not perfect. You can find my preferences for these in
[.perltidy](https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/blob/master/.perltidyrc) and
[.perlcritic](https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/blob/master/.perlcriticrc).

# Requirements

For perl6, you cannot code in my style without
[Slang::Tuxic](https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Tuxic), but that is only
needed for whitespace issues. You can do correct indentation without it.
